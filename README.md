# monitoring-business-performance

This is an industry partner capstone project by Generasi Gigih 3.0 and PT Toko Dizital Teknologi, using dummy data generated by Faker. The goal of this project is to fulfill Toko Dizitalâ€™s need for a business performance dashboard to monitor vendor transactions data and improve decision-making.

The developed dashboard will provide insights on key performance indicators, empowering the COO to make informed decisions quickly. By visualizing metrics such as sales trends and transaction rates, the dashboard will enhance the overall understanding of business performance.
