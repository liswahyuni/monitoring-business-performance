# monitoring-business-performance

This is an industry partner capstone project by Generasi Gigih 3.0 and PT Toko Dizital Teknologi using dummy data generated by `Faker`. This project’s goal is to fulfill Toko Dizital's need for a business performance dashboard to monitor vendor’s transactions data and improve decision-making.

The developed dashboard will offer insights on key performance indicators, empowering the COO to take the right decisions quickly. By visualising metrics such as sales trends and transaction rates, the dashboard will improve the overall understanding of business performance.
